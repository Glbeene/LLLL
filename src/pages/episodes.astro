I've created:

1. A new `EpisodeCard.astro` component that displays:
   - Episode title
   - Description
   - Platform links with icons (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Podbean)
   - Each platform link has a unique color and hover state

2. Updated `episodes.astro` to:
   - Use the new EpisodeCard component
   - Display episodes in a responsive grid
   - Include example episodes (you can replace these with your actual episodes)
   - Keep the "coming in 2025" message

The platform links are fully styled and include icons. Each link will open in a new tab and includes proper security attributes (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`).

You can customize the episodes array in `episodes.astro` with your actual episode data and platform links when they become available.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the design or f
